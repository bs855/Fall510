```
#Question 1a)
#using seq generates a sequence of numbers, in this case we are creating a vector that goes from 1 to 20 in increments of 1. the c() function combines the arguments to form a vector.
c(seq(from=1, to=20, by=1))
```

```
#Question 1b)
#using seq generates a sequence of numbers, in this case we are creating a vector that starts at 20 and ends at 1, decreasing in increments of 1. the c() function combines the arguments to form a vector.
c(seq(from=20, to=1, by=-1))
```

```
#Question 1c)
#this creates a vector that goes from 1 to 20 and then back down to 1 by manually combining all the numbers in the sequence.  
c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
```

```
#Question 1d)
#assigns the vector (4,6,3) to the variable tmp
tmp <- c(4,6,3)
```

```
#Question 1e)
#rep(x, times) is replicating the values in x the number of times listed. in this case we are replicating the vector (4,6,3) 10 times in order to achieve our goal of 10 occurrences of 4 
rep(c(4,6,3), times=10)
```

```
#Question 1f)
#rep(x, times) is replicating the values in x the numbers of times listed. in this case we are replicating each element of the vector by the corresponding number of times in the other vector. for example, 4 is replicated 11 times, 6 is replicated 10 times, and 3 is replicated 10 times.
rep(c(4,6,3),c(11,10,10))
```

```
#Question 1g)
#rep(x, times) is replicating the values in x the numbers of times listed. in this case we are replicating each element of the vector by the corresponding number of times in the other vector. for example, 4 is replicated 10 times, 6 is replicated 20 times, and 3 is replicated 30 times. 
rep(c(4,6,3),c(10,20,30))

```
#Question 2)
#creates a vector of values of exp(x)*cos(x) where x is a sequence of numbers running from 1 to 6 by 0.1. x is the variable for the sequence range. solve_x defines the formula we are trying to solve. solve_x then prints out the the results for each x in the sequence.
x <- seq(from=3, to=6, by=.1)  
solve_x <- exp(x)*cos(x)
solve_x
```

```
#Question 3a)
#creates a vector with 2 sets of increasing exponents. x is the variable for the 1st set of exponents that range from 3 to 36 and increase by increments of 3. y is the variable for the 2nd set of exponents that range from 1 to 34 and increase by increments of 3. z is the variable for vector we are solving for. z then prints out the results for each x and y in the sequence.
x <- seq(from=3, to=36, by=3)
y <- seq(from=1, to=34, by=3)
z <- rep(c(0.1^x*0.2^y))
z
```

```
#Question 3b)
#creates a vector with 2 sets of increasing exponents. x is the variable for the 1st set of exponents that range from 1 to 25 and increase by increments of 1. y is the variable for the 2nd set of exponents that range from 1 to 25 and increase by increments of 1. z is the variable for vector we are solving for. z then prints out the results for each x and y in the sequence.
x <- seq(from=1, to=25, by=1)
y <- seq(from=1, to=25, by=1)
z <- rep(c(2^x/y))
z
```

```
#Question 4a)
#we are solving for the summation that ranges from 10 to 100 for the given formula. i is the variable that defines the range of the summation by using the seq() function we used earlier. solve_i is the variable that defines the formula. solve_i then prints out the results for each i in the sequence.
i <- seq(from=10, to=100, by=1)
solve_i <- (i^3 + 4*i^2) 
solve_i
```

```
#Question 4b)
#we are solving for the summation that ranges from 1 to 25 for the given formula. i is the variable that defines the range of the summation by using the seq() function we used earlier. solve_i is the variable that defines the formula. solve_i then prints out the results for each i in the sequence.

solve_i
```

```
#Question 5a)
#we use the paste function to create character vector of the word label. the word label will have a space after it followed by the corresponding # that ranges from 1-30. 
paste("label ", 1:30, sep="")
```

```
#Question 5b)
#we use the paste function to create character vector of the word fn. the word fn will not have a space after it and will be followed by the corresponding # that ranges from 1-30. 
paste("fn", 1:30, sep="")
```

#Question 6a)
#set.seed is an integer vector that contains the random number generator state. xVec is a variable that defines the x vector of random numbers with replacement from 0-999. yVec does the same thing only defines the y vector. i defines the sequence that will be used for the y variable index and ranges from 2-250 (for example, if i=2 then that represents the index 2 for the y vector). j does the same thing only for the x vector but ranges from 1 to 249 since x runs to n-1
